everything from the Hatton Garden Bespoke Diamond Jewellery Workshop.  Exciting times lay ahead as we move increasingly into the private market and create designs of our own for our discerning clientele.</p><p>A little about us, our story will be a good way to start this.</p><p>The H.G.B Hallmark and what it stands for. </p><p>H.G.B is the unique hallmark of Hatton Garden Bespoke.But it isn't just a stamp placed by the governing body the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, it runs far deeper than that...Yes by UK law we are required to submit our work to the Assay office for it to receive its hallmarks that show the metal type and fineness, a date stamp and even the assay office that stamped it (London is the Leopard head) but it also importantly shows you who made your ring. The craftsmanship and the real person behind your piece is stamped there for posterity sake, it is the pieces pedigree and proof of lineage. A mark that shows it was made here, in London, in the H.G.B workshop. Irrefutable and permanent. </p><p>At H.G.B we strive to achieve as close to perfection as the human hand can get. It is the continuing search for this that keeps the work flowing.</p><p>You will have your work designed here, by a person. You will have your work made here, by a person. The stones will be picked and sourced entirely and completely for you and you alone.The ring will then be made to your chosen stone, not crashed out in a mass produced fashion. Not outsourced and passed off.</p><p> If it says H.G.B it is H.G.B.This workshop will be where your individual and uniquely Bespoke ring will be crafted by hand, from the raw bullion using techniques as old as the hills. Passion, dedication to the highest degrees of finish and ultimately (utterly by choice) the sacrificing of a normal life that all artists true to their calling will make for you the client.There are no salesmen here, nor do I have shop fronts on high commissions for sales. There is no fakery, smoke or mirrors, just my small workshop that cares so much about making you the very best piece that can possibly be made to your very individual budget.You know, those of you who've enquired, that I will bend over backwards to make you the best ring I can and often take less from a job personally to do so.You also know, those of you that are currently on my 'Saving up' list, that where I feel your budget would get you a ring where the balance of value falls to the metalwork and not your stone as it should be, that instead of taking your money and profiting from your lack of knowledge of my trade I will advise you so that you can wisely invest in a piece that uses your hard earned folding in the best way possible. I need to earn to live and for my young family to prosper but my promise to you is I will never prosper at your loss.23 years of hard slog in this trade (squeezing in 36 years of actual labour time into 23 years) at my bench has given me the skill set I need to produce you 'one' of the best products you will ever find in London, but on top of this I know for fact that None will match my level of service and care to you the client.H.G.B is a new type of beast in this increasingly cynical world, especially in this closeted trade, and has the clients interest at the heart of its day to day running. You all, I am sure, know by now that my entire soul goes into the creation of every single piece you see on the page.Integrity as an artist comes before my acting as a businessman every single time and always before my putting my feet up!My promise to you remains the same as ever. Your happiness is my goal in life as the creator of your beautifully bejewelled adornments.H.G.B is at its core about YOU and built entirely for YOU the H.G.B Army of Magpies & Amazons. You are all what make myself, my business and the H.G.B brand great.You are all an integral part of this legacy, so thank you in earnest for the commissions you entrust to me and the support you give daily. Whether it is a remake of Grandma's old jewellery, or an entirely new Engagement or wedding ring, it is your trust in me that gives me the strength to keep working so hard at my bench. For that belief in me I am eternally grateful to you all. </p><p>H.G</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="51"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="52"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="53"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="54"><span data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><h2 data-reactid="57"><a data-reactid="58">H.G.Bespoke</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="60"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="61"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="62"></div></section></div></div>
