Both of these rings are now complete and made with the sole purpose of giving my dear Magpies the first chance to procure either one of these before they go to the shops in time for the Christmas period.

The first is a 2.5ct Olive Brilliant cut Diamond in a handmade platinum button back of mine. The central stone is set with 18ct green gold claws and surrounded by 0.50cts of my collection quality E/F-Vs+ smalls set in the Pave style.  This 2.5ct is £10,183\. Inc. VAT

The second ring is a 1.21ct Fancy Yellow Cushion Cut in a platinum and 18ct yellow gold button back design. The central stone is set with 18ct Yellow gold claws as well as having an 18ct yellow gold button back.  
The ring is set with a further 0.38cts of my collection quality E/F-Vs+ smalls which in this case are set in the Micro setting style.  This 1.21ct is £7071\. Inc. VAT.
